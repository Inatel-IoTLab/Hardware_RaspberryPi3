#       completed. For QoS 0, this simply means that the message has left the
#       client. The mid variable matches the mid variable returned from the
#       corresponding publish() call, to allow outgoing messages to be tracked.

#       MQTT_LOG_ERR, and MQTT_LOG_DEBUG. The message itself is in buf.
